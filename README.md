# Hello, World!

This branch is reserved for all sorts of useful resources and cheatsheets I found on the internet. Some cheatsheets created by yours truly.


## SQL Injection Cheatsheet <--> **Credits to John Hammond :D**
> www.github.com/JohnHammond/miscellaneous/blob/master/SQL_INJECTION_CHEATSHEET.md

I have used this cheatsheet in many of my engagements whenever SQL injection was the way to exploit my victim. It is not a big cheatsheet by any means but it is very helpful and easy to understand and apply.

## PayloadAllTheThings Git Repo
> www.github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings

This is a GitHub repository that is full  of, as the name suggests, payloads. This is a very exhaustive list of payloads in all shapes and sizes. Whenever you find yourself at the weaponization stage of an engagement, make sure to give this a look.
Within this GitHub repository, a big number of other types of cheatsheets can be found, from methodology and enumeration cheatsheets to  network pivoting techniques, Active Directory attacks and even more. You can even find exploits based on their respective CVE number.

## Reverse Shell Cheatsheet
>www.revshells.com

This website is an automated tool to generate reverse shell payloads. It has an easy to understand user interface and lots of ways to create a reverse, bind or even a MSFVenom shell payload. It is a complex and easy to use resource that saves you time and adds a customability factor to your work.
