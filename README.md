# Hello, World!

This branch is reserved for all sorts of useful resources and cheatsheets I found on the internet. Some cheatsheets I will create myself.


### *SQL Injection
*credits to John Hammond*

*Leak names of all databases as a string*
SELECT GROUP_CONCAT( SCHEMA_NAME ) FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA




There are currently only three branches: 
### *TryHackMe 
### *VulnHub
### *HackTheBox
Inside of them, you'll find .pdf files uploaded by yours truly, showing my way of achieving r00t access to the boxes presented and some small talk about the methodologies, practices and some memes here and there.

# Note 1
All passwords/usernames/flags that I find in these challenges will be blurred out so that anyone looking through this repository, trying to do a CTF challenge, will not be able to 'continue' with their respective challenge since they will literally still have to do the hard  work of typing stuff up in order achieve their goal: root.

*There are more than 20 machines I have rooted from HackTheBox, I need to find the time to write the actual reports. If you have any questions, about any machine, don't hesitate to contact me and I will try my best to help.

# Note 2
I will be adding a cheatsheet branch to this repository. This cheatsheet section will be populated by links and information on all sorts of useful things such as payload generators, SQL Injection shortcuts/cheatsheets, and msfvenom content to name a few things. 11/05/2021
