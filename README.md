# Hello, World!

This GitHub repository is here to serve the less experienced InfoSec community break through some challenges found in CTFs on the internet. The CTF Walkthroughs that I will be posting here are vulnerable Virtual Machines found on either [TryHackMe.com](https://tryhackme.com) or [VulnHub.com](https://vulnhub.com) 
([HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.eu) boxes will be added eventually.)

There are currently only two branches: TryHackMe & VulnHub.
Inside them, you'll find .pdf files uploaded by yours truly, showing my way of achieving r00t access to the boxes presented and some small talk about the methodologies, practices and some memes here and there.
